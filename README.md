![alt Space Invaders App](https://github.com/joseph4tw/p5_spaceInvaders/blob/master/spaceInvadersGif.gif?raw=true)

After watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biN3v3ef-Y0&index=5&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZiZxtDDRCi6uhfTH4FilpH) from [Dan Shiffman](https://twitter.com/shiffman) on making Space Invaders using p5.js, I decided to play around with it and share it on github.

I'm very new to [p5.js](p5js.org) so I figured this was a fun way to practice.

## Features
- Invaders have 3 hits to kill
- Invaders move faster as you kill more
- Invaders get smaller as they lose life
- You can use the mouse or keyboard for game play
- You lose if an invader hits you or they pass you and you don't kill them

## Example

Here's a page where you can play the game.
